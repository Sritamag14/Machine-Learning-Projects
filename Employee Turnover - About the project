Predicting Employee Turnover at Portobello Tech
This is my first, hands-on machine learning project that I completed using HR data. I analyzed employee details—like projects handled, monthly hours, tenure, promotions, salary levels, satisfaction, and evaluation scores—to build a predictive model for identifying employees at risk of leaving. Along the way, I:

Ensured data quality by handling missing values

Investigated top contributors to attrition

Clustered past leavers to uncover patterns in satisfaction and evaluation

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE

Trained and compared models with k‑fold validation

Evaluated performance using metrics like ROC‑AUC, F1‑score, precision, and recall

Translated model insights into strategic, data-backed retention suggestions

This project showcases my skills in feature engineering, model tuning, and turning analytics into actionable business recommendations.
